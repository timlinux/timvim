User: I want to harmonise the completion shortcuts. Currently we have:

Ctrl-y to accespt ghost text from copilot - I think we can keep this
ctrlJ ctrlK to move up and down the completion list with tab to accept
Tab to cycle the completion list with enter to accept

These last two cause me a lot of cognative dissonance and I would like to harmonise them to use the ctrlJ ctrlK Tab or Enter to accept

Can you do a deep analysis of my configuration in this flake and try to resolve this - and look for other inconsistencies with how popup selection works and harmonise it
Review the go support and confirm that nvim is set up to be a first class go editing environment. Compile a readme.go explaining how to use go syntax completion, debugging, compiling etc.
make a minimal go application and provide me instructions for running it in debug more in nvim so I can test
look at the error in the screenshot in my home folder
can you add a README.ubuntu.md file the provide nice clear instructions for an ubuntu user to use this flake and have it integrated into their system search path so that when they type timvim they get this flake managed vim

User: Id really like to have the asciified kartoza banner show up in neovim every time it starts
User: can you look back in the commit history - the kartoza alpha logo used to have colour and then it lost it at some point. Also can you look at the screenshot I made in my home directory and put gap between the icons and the text in the completion menus
[2026-02-04T08:53:50+00:00] User asked: I can see in alpha.nix the colours are defined for the logo but when it shows in nvim it does not overlay the colours and shows only the simple monochrome version. Also please remind me what the tools are to build the logo from an image
[2026-02-04T10:19:03+00:00] User reported: logo still shows in monochrome after charhl_to_bytehl fix. Root cause: Kartoza custom theme section runs 'highlight clear' at line 3800 of init.lua, after alpha pluginRC at line 1287, wiping all T2A highlight groups. Fix: wrapped highlights in setup_t2a_highlights() function and call it in VimEnter autocmd (after theme loading completes) plus ColorScheme autocmd for future theme changes.
2026-02-08: User asked about difficulty copying text out of Neovim. Wanted vim motions yank to go to system clipboard and mouse highlight to go to primary selection (middle-click).
Solution: Updated clipboard.nix to use "unnamedplus,unnamed" registers (syncs both system clipboard and primary selection), and added mouse="a" option.
2026-02-08: Follow-up - user also wanted paste FROM system clipboard and primary selection INTO vim.
Added keybindings in keymaps.nix:
- Ctrl+Shift+V pastes from system clipboard (+) in insert and command mode
- Middle mouse pastes from primary selection (*) in insert and normal mode
