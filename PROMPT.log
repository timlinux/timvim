User: I want to harmonise the completion shortcuts. Currently we have:

Ctrl-y to accespt ghost text from copilot - I think we can keep this
ctrlJ ctrlK to move up and down the completion list with tab to accept
Tab to cycle the completion list with enter to accept

These last two cause me a lot of cognative dissonance and I would like to harmonise them to use the ctrlJ ctrlK Tab or Enter to accept

Can you do a deep analysis of my configuration in this flake and try to resolve this - and look for other inconsistencies with how popup selection works and harmonise it
